# Heia bubu #
Heia bubu is an open source, object oriented, functional, typed, high-performance language

## Why Heiabubu? ##
Speed! The performance of programms is in the foreground with Heiabubu.
In some benchmarks on my Linux machine it computed the 46. fibonacci number in 8.5s.
C++ took 16s and Python took 340s.
That's a 2x speedup to c++ and a 40x speedup over python!


## State of developement ##
Heia bubu is still in pre release and not very safe to use yet. It's also in a state of change, due to many adaptments and bugs.

## Platforms ##
 - [x] Linux
 - [ ] Windows (coming soon)
